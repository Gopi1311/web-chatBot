# Building a Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a support agent chatbot tailored to address "how-to" questions about four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot is designed to retrieve relevant information from the official documentation of these platforms, providing users with step-by-step guidance for completing specific tasks or achieving desired outcomes. Additionally, it offers enhanced functionalities, such as handling diverse question variations, addressing cross-CDP comparisons, and delivering advanced assistance.
